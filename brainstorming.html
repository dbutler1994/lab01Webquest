        <h1>Brainstorming</h1>

        <p>
            To get started, get in a group of four and discuss what you know, or you think you know, about video games and violence. Your initial discussion should be based around the following points:

            <ul>
                <li>examples of violent games you know/play</li>
                <li>the type of violence, i.e. fighting, shooting etc...</li>
                <li>what you feel when playing these violent games</li>
                <li>any real world cases of violence that have been related to video games</li>
                <li>your initial thoughts about the influence of violent games on behaviour.</li>
            </ul>

        </p>
